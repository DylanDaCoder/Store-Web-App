    <p><a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> provides access to cheap, essential and cool electronic component supplies for all of South Africa.</p>

    <p><a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> manufactures various devices that require electronics, software and a bit of imagination. This website was developed by Leobot Electronics for example.</p>
    
    <p><a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> helps hobbyists, amateurs and inventors realise their dreams at the lowest cost possible. Whether you simply need to convert a breadboard prototype with tangled wires to a simple PCB or need devices to accomplish specific tasks, maybe we can help.</p>

    <p><a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> has a mission to provide all citizens of South Africa access to low-cost, high-quality electronic components ranging from the most basic and most essential to the most exotic and extravagant.

    <br>    
<a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> wants to place South Africa firmly on the map as Electronic Component producer; electronic components are cheap enough for the poor to purchase them but many a time they simply lack the access to proper education on how to start producing electronic systems. Our mission is to help the people of South Africa help themselves out of poverty.

<a href="index.html">Tech Studio</a> has a mission to research and develop ways of generating clean energy. There is electricity all around us; we are walking on an ocean of electrons; the challenge is how to harness the power at the lowest possible cost and no damage to nature.</p>
